# AoC-2022-Solutions-In-Kotlin
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions for the year 2022 in Kotlin!
My code isn't the shortest or efficient code you'll find, I try to keep
the code login clear while making it as concise as I can.
You can read about the solutions [here](https://threadsnappers.github.io/advent-of-code-kotlin/).

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
